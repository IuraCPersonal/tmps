# STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS IN PYTHON

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## ADAPTER

__Adapter__ is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### PROBLEM

Imagine that youâ€™re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But thereâ€™s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.

You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the libraryâ€™s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.

### SOLUTION

You can create an _adapter_. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isnâ€™t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
2. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapterâ€™s methods.
3. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.

Sometimes itâ€™s even possible to create a two-way adapter that can convert the calls in both directions.

## BRIDGE

The __bridge__ pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently"

### PROBLEMS

- An abstraction and its implementation should be defined and extended independently from each other.
- A compile-time binding between an abstraction and its implementation should be avoided so that an implementation can be selected at run-time.

### SOLUTIONS

- Separate an abstraction (Abstraction) from its implementation (Implementor) by putting them in separate class hierarchies.
- Implement the Abstraction in terms of (by delegating to) an Implementor object.

## DECORATOR

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

### PROBLEMS

- Responsibilities should be added to (and removed from) an object dynamically at run-time.
- A flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality should be provided.

### SOLUTIONS

- implement the interface of the extended (decorated) object (Component) transparently by forwarding all requests to it
- perform additional functionality before/after forwarding a request.

## FACADE

The __facade__ pattern (also spelled _faÃ§ade_) is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. 

A facade can:

- improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) API
- provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
- serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code

### PROBLEMS

- To make a complex subsystem easier to use, a simple interface should be provided for a set of interfaces in the subsystem.
- The dependencies on a subsystem should be minimized.

### SOLUTIONS

Define a Facade object that:

- implements a simple interface in terms of (by delegating to) the interfaces in the subsystem and
- may perform additional functionality before/after forwarding a request.

This enables to work through a Facade object to minimize the dependencies on a subsystem.

## PROXY

__Proxy__ is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

### PROBLEMS

Why would you want to control access to an object? Here is an example: you have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources. You need it from time to time, but not always.

You could implement lazy initialization: create this object only when itâ€™s actually needed. All of the objectâ€™s clients would need to execute some deferred initialization code. Unfortunately, this would probably cause a lot of code duplication.

In an ideal world, weâ€™d want to put this code directly into our objectâ€™s class, but that isnâ€™t always possible. For instance, the class may be part of a closed 3rd-party library.

### SOLUTIONS

The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.

But whatâ€™s the benefit? If you need to execute something either before or after the primary logic of the class, the proxy lets you do this without changing that class. Since the proxy implements the same interface as the original class, it can be passed to any client that expects a real service object.

## CONCLUSION/RESULTS

Structural Patterns describe the design method, identifying a simple way to implement class relationships. They help to combine objects for larger structure.

During this laboratory work, I implemented the following patterns: 

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Decorator
- Facade
- Proxy
